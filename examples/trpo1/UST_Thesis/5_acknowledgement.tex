\centerline{{\bf \Large Acknowledgments}} \vspace{5mm} \noindent

Foremost, I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung, for his kindness, generosity, open-mindedness, and his continuous support of my study.

Besides my advisor, I'd like to thank my fellow labmates Shi Xingjian, Li Siyi, Gao Zhihan and Leonard Lausen, for the countless valuable discussions in these two years.
