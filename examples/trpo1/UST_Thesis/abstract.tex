Abstract

Solving realistic problems automatically without domain-specific engineering has been one of the most fascinating problems in artificial intelligence. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved significant progress in game problems. However, a scalable, autonomous solution to realistic problems is still missing.

This thesis studies investigate several multi-modal continuous control environments with sparse rewards, which are considered some typical complex realistic problems. We propose several methods that can solve these problems.
